My second solo project, I started this game at 16: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XM459RQnoo

It's a 2D Networked top-down shooter.

Each player gets 4 weapons: rifle, stealth, mines and missiles. Each kill drops an orb and each orb grants a 10% chance to gain one of many stack-able buffs alongside an addition to your defense. The higher your K/D, the higher this defense addition will be for the orb you drop, so the better you are doing, the more interest others will have in killing you.
